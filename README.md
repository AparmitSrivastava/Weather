## 🌦 Weather
A simple weather web application that allows users to check real-time weather conditions for any city.

## My First Project: ☁️
This was my first major project in web development. Before this, I practiced CSS, HTML, and JavaScript through various exercises.
- I built this app after learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- Initially, I didn’t upload my small practice exercises, but I’ve now started documenting them in my practice repo.
